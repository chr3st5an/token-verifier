## Features

---

This program allows you to easily check which discord user tokens are valid and which aren't. The main goal of this program is it, to do it fast and reliable while being relative resource lightweight. This is achieved by using an asynchronously programming style.

## Getting Started

---

### Prerequisites

In order to use this script, you will need Python 3.8 or later and pip. You can download Python from the [official website](https://python.org/downloads). Once installed, you should automatically have pip. You can verify this by running the following commands in a terminal or command prompt:

- python

```bash
python -V
```

- pip

```bash
python -m pip -V # or just 'pip -V'
```

You are ready to go if everything worked perfectly. Otherwise check out this [installation guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

## Usage

---

You can use this tool by simple running the `verifier.py` file:

```bash
python verifier.py
```

The program will now ask you for the file which contains the tokens. It's import to either enter an absolute or relative path to the file, e.g. `C:\Users\Example\tokens.txt` or `..\tokens.txt`. If the tokens aren't saved in a file yet, create a simple `txt` file and save them in there.

Once you enter path, the program will do it's magic and show you which tokens are valid and which aren't.
